# SIT323-AT1 - Text File Requested

This is my current code.

So far it validates the names of the files, the allocation data, some of the invalid keywords and blank spaces and so on. I have started work on validating the entire Taff File but I am struggling with validating the actual tasks themselves but there should be some code related to that already.

I am struggling a lot with the StreamReader commands and reading multiple lines to work on validating and calculating the processors and tasks. I understand I am already close to the submission time but I have spent several days starting from scratch since I'd often break something too much to go back, on top of several thousands of words of other stuff for my miss managed unit.

I haven't felt comfortable coming to Jason due to the class environment being very awkward which I understand is my fault as well.

I feel like I am making progress and today I've come up with some ideas to get over the multiple lines problems by using arrays or a list but I still dont seem to have got it down yet.

I do want to mention that other students say they have reached over 9000 lines of code and that seems a bit much for a solo project. And the "we're not here to teach you how to code" attitude is very damaging. Considering one of the pre-requisites deals in mostly VueJS (120) and not a single second of c# and a lot of the expected knowledge from 232 comes from the D/HD tasks, the expectations are the reason some students are doing this unit for the third time trying to pass.
